# Phoria Table Tennis

Let's play some table tennis!!
This is a sample application for Phoria developer applicants. It is a fictional application for you to show off your skills.

## Prerequisites

#### Ruby

This application uses _Ruby version 3.0.2_. Please ensure you have this version installed locally.

#### Bundler

You will also need the Bundler gem (version 2+).
Bundler can be installed by running `gem install bundler`. Note if you had to download ruby 3.0.2, you'll have to install bundler for this ruby version.

#### Git

We use git for version control, and we expect you do too.
Please commit your code as you work through this sample application.

## Getting started

1. Unzip the challenge files
   If you're reading this, you can tick this one off!

2. Ensure you have the prerequisites listed above
   Otherwise, you're gonna have a bad time.

3. Create a brand new git repo
   There are three steps to this:

- running `git init` to create a new git repo, and
- creating a repo on your cloud provider of choice (e.g. Github/Bitbucket)
- connecting the two, usually by running `git remote add origin <your-repo-url>`

4. Set up the table tennis application
   The application uses a SQLite database which makes setup easy.
   Running the following commands should get you set up and ready to go:

- `bundle install`
- `rails db:setup`

5. Save and push your first commit (to master)
   Do this as soon as the application is ready to go, rather than discovering later that you can't push to Github and now can't show us the amazing work you've done.

6. Checkout and work on a new branch
   At Captur3d, we almost always do our work in a separate branch to master, committing as we go along, and then create a Pull Request for other team members to review. We'd like you to do the same here, so that we can easily see the changes you've made.

- `git checkout -b develop`

Okay, hopefully everything is set up and ready to go! Let us know if you have any issues getting this set up.

## Finished?

Great work!

Push your commits to your branch in Github/Bitbucket, create a Pull Request to merge your branch into master (but don't actually merge it), and make sure we can access your repo.

Let us know that you've completed the homework tasks, and we'll be in touch!
